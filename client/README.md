# Client (Frontend)

This directory contains the React frontend for the Market Map Application. It provides the user interface and interactive map for viewing and contributing market data.

## Main Files and Folders
- `public/`: Static assets and the main HTML file.
- `src/`: Source code for the React app.
  - `App.js`: Main React component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React app.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., AddMarketForm).
- `package.json`: Lists dependencies and scripts for running the frontend.

The frontend communicates with the backend server to fetch and display market and road closure data on an interactive map.
