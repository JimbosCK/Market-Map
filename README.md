# Market-Map Project

Market-Map is a full-stack web application designed to help users visualize and plan around weekly street markets that temporarily close roads in various regions. The application displays active and upcoming markets on an interactive map, allowing users to see which roads will be closed and contribute new market information.

## Project Structure
- `client/`: React frontend for the interactive map and user interface.
- `server/`: Node.js/Express backend providing a REST API and connecting to MongoDB.

## Key Features
- View all active and future markets on a map.
- Visualize closed road segments for each market.
- Add new markets and draw closed roads directly on the map.
- Color-coded markers for market status (active, verified, pending).

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Leaflet
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB

See the `client/` and `server/` directories for more details about each part of the project.
